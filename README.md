Champion Cooldown Tracker is a highly intuitive and interactive tool designed for League of Legends players of all skill levels. Our product provides real-time tracking and display of champion ability cooldowns, allowing players to manage their skills and strategies more effectively during gameplay.

The application utilizes the Riot Games API to fetch detailed information on champion abilities, including cooldown times, scaling factors, and ability icons. Players can input their champion's ability haste and the current level of their abilities to see accurate cooldown timers.
